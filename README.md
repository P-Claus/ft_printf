## Overview
As my second project in the Campus 19 common core, I chose to do ft_printf. In this project, I have to write a function that works in the same way as the standard printf function. The goal of this project is to work with variadic arguments and learn how they work.

## Mandatory
The function needs to work with the following format specifiers
* `%c` - prints a character
* `%s` - prints a string
* `%d` - prints a decimal (base 10) number
* `%i` - prints an integer in base 10
* `%u` - prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number
* `%x` - prints a lowercase hexadecimal number (base 16)
* `%X` - prints an uppercase hexadecimal number (base 16)
* `%p` - prints a void pointer in hexadecimal format
* `%%` - prints a % sign

## Result
I didn't make the bonus and my code passed the moulinette for the mandatory part. I know the code could be more efficient, but it was only my second project at Campus 19 and I passed.
